## NAME : REXLIN R
## REG NO: 212222220034
## AIM:
To evaluate and compare the UX of 2–3 competing apps or websites using heuristic principles, apply necessary design improvements, and assess the impact of changes using A/B testing methods.
## PROCEDURE:
1.Identify 2–3 similar apps or websites (e.g., food delivery or e-commerce) for heuristic evaluation.

2.Evaluate each using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics to identify UX flaws.

3.Record observed issues and suggest specific improvements for better user experience.

4.Redesign the problematic areas using UI/UX tools like Figma or Adobe XD.

5.Conduct A/B testing with both original and improved versions to study user behavior.

6.Analyze results to assess the impact of changes on usability, engagement, and efficiency.
